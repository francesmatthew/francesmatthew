### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a computer engineering student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County

I write code in Python, C++, x86 Assembly, and C. I work on computer hardware, including AVR-based microcontrollers and ARM-based Raspberry Pi's

Most of the code I write is under ownership of faculty at the university, but I am easy to reach by email
