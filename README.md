### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a computer engineering student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County

I love writing code in C++ and C, but I'm also experienced in Python, MATLAB, C#, and x86 Assembly. Most of my experience is in programs running in linux environments or on microcontrollers, but I am also familiar working in Windows.

Most of the code I write is under ownership of faculty at the university, but I am easy to reach by email
